    Add year group file (.smscgrpYYYY)
        Contains a list of .smscdtYYYY files for that year
    Add main file (.smscall)
        Contains a list of .smscgrpYYYY files (for multiple years)

    Use github.js to show the most recent commit

    (Maybe) Add PWA page caching (service worker)
    (Maybe) Add button to submit generated .smscdt file to some kind of backend (maybe php?), which could save it to a database of files
